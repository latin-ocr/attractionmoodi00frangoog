A

Subjunatives depending upon subjunctivae with simple volitive
or optative forae have been sufficiently treated above (pp. 5-o).

Β.

The alausas which depend upon a subjunctive of “surprise
or indignation,” though of volitive (“deliberative'') origin,
may well be treated in a separate paragraph, since they show
some important peculiarities Through the very nature of this
construction, it matters little whether the main and the depend-
ent verbs are in the same time-sphero3 for surprise or indignation
isexpressed as readily at an aot that took' plaoe iu the past as at
one of the present time. Ordinarily, in this gropp, it is easy to
tell from the context whether the seeondary verb has naturally

the feeling of the main verb. The following sentenoe affordsa .

good illustration of this alass: Phonn ato-3, ubi quoe lubitum
fuerit peregre secema neque huius eia neritus feminae primariae,
. . . uenias nune precibus lautum peaeatum'tuom! .

The mood of motae expresses the speaker'e (seigned) indigna·
tion. That same feeling extends‚¹ it seems tome, through fereris,
and aas ueritas, sinae these dwell upon the very aete whieh eaused
¹ the anger. It probably does not extend into the explanatory
olause quoa lubitum fuerit, or, if it does, it extends with far less
forae. I should say that feceris and aia ueritus are in the sub
jurative for the same reason that urowa is, but that lubitum faerit

1111 tha following examples, in vvhioh tha main verbs ara in the indicativa,
1 should proferto interpret the dependent subjunctivae as dua to indignation
and surprise rather than to an adversativa feeling.
