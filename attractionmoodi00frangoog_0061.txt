keeps six verbs out of attraction, it is impossible to say that all of
the subjunctive examples are due to the regular habit of dum =
until to take that mood. Since, however, it was impossible to
call any of them undoubted instances of attraction, Ι have not
admitted any of this kind into my tables in Chapter ΙΙ. For the
sake of completeness, Ι shall give a list here oi the nine which

are subjunctive and depend upon other subjunctivae They are:
Oisa 182, M. G. 1249, Truc 482,Α11(11. 980, Pseud. 1234, Ourc.

52611116. 328, Rud. 1190, Trin. 151.

A mle is sometimes found in the handbooks stating that cer-
tain conjunctione which are used with both moods avoid attrac
tion in order to prevent confusion, and that dum is one of these.
A glauce at the table will show that so iar was Early Latin from
thus distinguishing between dum = until and its other uses, that
there are as many instances (14) of dum = while in the subjunc-
tive as of the avoidance oi attraction by the same particle. We
have seen (p. 13) that all the evidence seems rather to point to a
sarciool of an early anticipatory subjunctive use, even with this
meaning, when the verb refers to the future

Priusquam presente some oi the same difficulties as dum, because
even when it stands free, it takes the subjunctive at times It is,
’ however, saie to say that a just share of the subjunctives which
are in dependence upon other verbs oi that mood should be attrib
uted to the growing habit oi attraction, since priusquam in Early
Latin, when standing free, takes the indicative iar more frequently
than the subjunctive. Priusquam does not seem to take the sub
junctive in Terence.1 I therefore feel saie in attributing the mood
of Eun. 151 to the influenoe oi the main verb. The passages in
doubt are: Rnd. 456, Men. 84611151. 1015, Aul. 154, Epid. 211,
Truc. 523, Pseud. 1031, Bacch 115, Trin. 886.

A further reason ior the prepondersnce oi the subjunctive in
temporal clauses is that these are usually adverbial clauses and
as such generally depend more closely upon the governing verb
than do relative clauses, which are, as a rule, attached to the sub
ject or objectos the verb. Similarly, it is obvious that relative
