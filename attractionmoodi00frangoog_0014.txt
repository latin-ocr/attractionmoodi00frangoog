the main verb, or, though grammatically in the same tense, is
not in the same time-sphere—or, to state the matter in another
way, the conditione in which either relationis reasonable, and
there is nothing to determine which is meant Such a state oi
things may be seen in Epid 283, iam igitur amota ei fuerit omnis
consultatio nuptiarum, ne grauetur quod uelis, “ dismies at once
then the whole question oi marriage, lest he shall begrudge you
what you vvish.'' Either “ vvish '’ or “shall wish '’ is here rea-
sonable, and nothing in the context bars either meaning. Such
combinatione formed a bridge from theuso of the subjunctive oi
“like feeling '' to the use oi the subjunctive ct “formal like-
ness'' in the dependent clause, and thus carried the mood over
from its original domain in the former field to a new domain in
the letter.

Distinctly unfavoreble are the conditione when there is a shttt
in tense as well as in timesphere‚ as when a verb in the past
depende grammatically upon a future verb of willing or wishing,
as in Oas 503, ut quod madoci curet, “ that he may execute the
commissione which I have given ”3 or, to take a subjunctive, in
Rud. 1243, ut cum maiore dote abeat quam edocuerit, “ that she

Ι may depart with a larger dowry than she brought with her.''
Here adceperit, a verb of past time, could not share in the future

volitive idea expressed by the mood and tense of abeat. In sen·
tences of this type, then, ie found the extreme of the fully devel-
oped habit of attraction. Ι

With this preliminary explanation, we pass to an enumeration
and discussion oi the various kinds of subjunctives after which
the verb oi the dependent clause is at times found to contain the
same model feeling as that ot* the main clause (“ subjunctive of ’
like faelicp'').

I find these kinds to be as follows 2¹ .

’ J ussive and Permissive.
“Deliberative’' and its extensione
1. Volitive Subjunctive (snbjunctive oi Surprise or In·
dignation).
Dependent Volitive.
