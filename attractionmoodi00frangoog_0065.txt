(5) When the antecedent is expressed and is 5 demonstrative
prononn Oi. Lucil. 572, concedat id quod uelit (18 examples).

3. It may also bs attached to the indirect object 51 the verb.
Of. Pseud. 570, det locum illi qui queat (5 examples).

4. Orto the object of a complementary infinitive depending
upon the subjunctive verb, or forming its subject. Of. Aul. 600,
quod iubeat properet persequi; and Mer. 152, ut quae scirem
scire actutum tibi liceret (5 examples).

5. Orto a substantive in an adverbia] clause which modifies
the predicate, as in Hec. 491, exopto ut relicuam uitam exigat
aum eo uiro me qui sit fortunatior. So also Oist. 85.

6. As regards the adverbial clauses, the larger part 51 these

(5) (114) depend directly upon the governing verb, usually by
means of a temporal conjunction, as in
Ι Pseud 307, quando nil sit, simul amare desinat
We have already shown (p. 50) that this is the chief reason

why so large a proportion 51 temporal clauses suffer attraction.
Furthermore, many adverbial clauses are attracted which are
not directly attached to the verb, but

(5) depend upon some modifier of the subject, as
Pers. 237, Numquam . . . exterebrabis tu ut sis peior quam
ego siem. Of. Truo 96. ’

(5) Or of the object. Of. Hec. 729,
uidendumst ne minus propter iram hinc impetrem quam pos·
siem. Of. Pers. 340.

(d) Or which depend upon a second adverbial modifier of the
predicate, as in Rud. 1243, ut cum maiore dote abeat quam
aduenerit Of. Bacch. 4883 Hec. 5553 Aul. 17.

It is worthy 51 note that the last three classes contain for the

most part adverbial clauses 51 comparison with quam, and that
many of these clauses are of necessity far removed grammatically
from the governing verb, and therefore remain in the indicative.
On the other hand, it is readily seen thatin a sentence like the
last one cited (Rud. 1243) the dependent verb advenerit, even
though a second remove from 55551 grammatically, is, in simi·
larjty 51 function and in position, very near to it; consideratione
which probably weigh as heavily as that 51 grammatical prox·
imity in determining the mood of the verb.
