clauses in dependenca upon the object 61 the verb are more closely
connected with that verb than those which are attached 16 the
subject, and are in consequence more likely to be attracted, 66 16
proved by the table hereto appended. This table includes only
such examples as depend direetly upon the subject, verb 61 object.

Ι Fifty-six per cent. 61 the subjunctivae are in clauses which depend
direetly upon the verb, whereas but tw0ntyeight per cent. of the
indicatives are in such clauses

It 16 66 doubt the failure to make this fundamental distinction
which has led grammarians into the erroneous conclusion that the
indicative is kept in “ circumlocutione equivalent to a substan·
tivc,'' a statement which not only faiis to give the real 166666 161
the actual phenomena, but even misstates the facts in the case.
A very considerable number 61 clauses of this kind are in fact
attracted See, for example, the following:

Men. 994, Oaue quisquam quod illic minitetur nostrum flocci
1666111 (quod minitetur: minas eius).
Eun. 1026, ut . . . faciam quod iubeat (quod iubeat=iussa
eius).
Add 16 these Phorm. 125, Trin. 211, Bacch. 788, Trin. 715, Eun
790 and many others. It is not true, therefore, that verbs 61
this kind are never attracted. However, the majority are not, and
the real cause 61 this 1661 16 that such clauses usually modify the
subject 61 object 61 the sentence or modifiers 61 these, and are not,
therefore, as closely bound up with the governing verb as the ad·
verbial clauses are. In fact, the table just given shows that almost
70 per cent. 61 such clauses after subjunctive verbs remain in the
indicative.
Some 61 the adverbial clauses present difficulties which call 161
6 few words 61 explanation.
