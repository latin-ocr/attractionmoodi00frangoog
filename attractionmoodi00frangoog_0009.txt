Al'I'RAOTION OF MOOD IN EARLY LATIN.

INTRODUOTION.

Notwithstanding the great activity of scholare iu the field of
Latin syntax during the last half century, the subject oi attrac-
tion of mood in the Latin langusge has passed almost unnotioed
The reason is not that the subject is already clearly understood.
On the contrary, most of the statements in regard to itin the
handbooks are, at least in part, erroneous, and couicssedly are
based upon very mesger data Neithsr is it a matter of small
importance; for at few points does fine feeling lor the shades
of meaning of moods more aliect the interpretation oi a Latin
sentence than in the usages of this construction. Nevertheless
it has been slighted I lind but one treatment oi the subject that
pretends in any way to be thoroughgoing. Eveu this touches a
very limited field, namely a part oi Oioero3 does not get com·
plcte data from this; makes little attempt at digestiug the mate·
rial gathcrcd ; and uses a method of treatment which is somewhat
antiquated. I refer to the program oi Franz Peters‚¹ published
in 1861. The substance of his trectise may be found in
Drueger,2 ,whose lists are as full and valuable as any yet puh
lished on the subject. Draeger's examples are taken mainly
from Oioero. The sams is true of Kiihner's examplas⁸ Ziemer⁴
should also bc mentioned ior some suggestive remarks on the
subject

Several dissertatione upon special constructione have oi neces-

, sity touched upon the subject in passing, but have hardly affected

the discussion of the problem, 'since they have approaohed it only
