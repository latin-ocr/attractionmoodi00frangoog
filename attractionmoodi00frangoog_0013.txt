way3 and that these must be distinguished from those which are
in reality due to the babit of attraction pure and simple. The
distinction might well be expressed in the terms of Professor
Hale, who speaks oi the mood oi “like feeling ’' and that of
“formal likeness.”¹

We are to seek, then, for combinatione in which the model ieel-
ing expressed by the main verb may naturally cast its shadow
over the subjunctive clause. Obviously, there would be a lim·
ited number of conditions under which this is possible.

The conditions are iavorable when both the verbs (main and
subordinate) are in the same grammatieal tense, and are placed in
the same actual timesphere. Such a state of affairs may be illus·
nated by the examples above, or by Aul. 491, quo lubebat, nubant,
“let them marry where they please,'' i. e, “let them choose their
place, and marry there.'’

These clauses occur ireely in dependenoe upon subjunctives of
“ volition,'’ “ wish‚’' “ permission ’' and the like I add further
illustrationsz
With a subjunctive of permission:

Bacch. 656, furetur quod queat, “let him steal what he can''

(“ what he shall be ableto steal'').
With a subjunctive of wish:

Hec. 197, di uortant bene quod apua, “May the gods further

what you do ’' (“ shall do '').
With a substantive volitive clause:

Bacch. 674, occasio . . . fuit . . . ut pacatum uelles tantum
sumeres, “there was opportunity to take as much as you
wished '' (“ as much as you should wish ''). ’

The conditions are less favorable when the subjunctive verb,
though in the same grammatical tense, is notin the sometime
sphere as that of the main clause. An example may be seen in
(ias. 252, iam domuisti animum . . . ut, quod uir uelit fieri, id
faciasl ‘·‘ have you brought your mind to do (i. e, will you do l)
that which your husband desiresl ''

Between themora favorable conditions and the less favorable
lie the conditions in which it is impossible to tell from the con-
text whether the subordinate verb is in the same time-sphere with
