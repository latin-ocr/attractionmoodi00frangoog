Some of the conclusione ιο be drawn from these comparative
lists are obvious. Meohauieal attraction is of relatively rare oo·
currence in Early Latin Even when the dependent verb is in
the same tense as the governing clause, very little emphasis is
needed to prevent assimilatien. In fact, only about thirty-live per
cent. of the verbe closely attached ιο a verb in the subjunctive are
found in the same moed, and more than half of these belong ιο the
class which seemed in the preceding discussion ιο be influenoed ιο
a great extent by the anticipatory subjunctive. Itis impossible,
however, ιο give absolutely accurate ratius, since, as will appear
later, it is not often possible ιο fix in either class the verbs con·
nected with conjunctione that may take either the indicative or
the subjunctive Such conjunctione are, for instance, priaaqrrcm
dum and ei in early Latin

By a closer analysis of the lists of examplea given abore, we
may discover to some extent the conditione under which the habit
of attraction began ιο spread, or, the converse, the conditione under
which the new construction did not thrive The following conclu·
sione are based not only upon the examples of mechanical attrac-
tion, but on the examplee discussed in chap. 1, us well; for it is
obviously impossible ιο state in every case whether the subjunctive
is entirely or merely in part due to the force of nwcbom'col

Α attraction.

The most ἱιοροοιοοι clement is that of time, as has been implied
by the olaseification itself. Το be sure, this is not of equal impert
ance in all constructione So, for instance, attention has been called
to the fact that a break in time-sphera does not effect the mood
of clausae in dependence upon subjunctivae of surprise, remon·

suance, or indignation. of course, conditional and independent
