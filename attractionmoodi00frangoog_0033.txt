and that over half of those which ατο in the subjunctive are also in
dependence upon subjunctives and infinitives, goes to show that
many of the latter must be due to attractioc. In general the same
condition of things obtains with the priusquamclauses With
siclauses, the feeling of the less vivid future is so subtile in early
Latin that, in the majority of cases where the present subjunctive
is found with si in dependence upon another subjunctive, I believe
it is impossible to say with certainty whether the writer would
have used an indicative, if the clause had not been thus dependent
(see p. 54). In cases of this class, accordingly, it must be under·
stood that the list of subjunctives is not as complete as that of the
indicatives.

A fair comparison of the two uses may be made in the temporal
clauses with cum, nbi, and quando, as well as in the quiclauses
of Plautus and Terence. The following table will show a marked
preponderance of the subjunctive in clauses which refer tc the
future and depend upon another subjunctive.

Indioative 10 5 5 10 30

This proportion cf the subjunctive to the indicative becomes sig·
nificant when one finds that, in early Latin, attraction is rather
the exception than the rule, and that about thirty-five per cent. of
the clauses which, so far as functicn and position are eoncemed,
arc capable of being attracted, are in fact so affected The tense,
therefore, is significant3 and the examinatior has confirmed the
theory that the anticipatcry subjunctive was still a force in Latin
during the time of Plautus. If then it is found to “ supply a large
factor tc the development of attraction,” it will readily be seen
from the list just given that the factor is excoedingly important,
for this class alone makes up about 55 per cent of all the early
r Latin verbs that are usually classed as subjunctives by attraction
inthegrammars. Ε
The note quoted above (p. 4) from Professor Hale's paper
on the Anticipatory Subjunctive gives a good illustraticn, from
conditional sentences, cf the kind of verb now under discussion:
