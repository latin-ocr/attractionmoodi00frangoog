A minuter classification must now be made in order to deter
mine how closely the dependent clause must be attached to the
main body oi the governing clause, in order to be attracted It
has appeared in the above that not only may those verbs be at
tracted which are found in adverbial clauses and in direct depend-
ence upon the subjunctive verb, but also those which are attached

to the subjector object oi the same. In Early Latin this state
³ ment is not to be understood as applying to clauses after ante
¹cedente complete in themselves, wbieh‘ romain in the indicative

(cf. Cato 84, uideto ut bene pereoeas medium, ubi altissimum .

est), nor to any of the loosely attached coordinata relative clauses,
the “ forward moving clauses,'' or parenthetical asides. It refers
to the closely attached clause which is necessary to complete the

meaning ot the antecedent expressed or understood
1. In Early Latin the relative clause, uben attached to tlte aab

. jeet or attribute complacuerat of tlte sciaterwe, is found to be at
tracted under the following conditione:

(o) When the antecedent oi the relative is not expressed, as in
Amph 630, diligens ut quae imperes compareant (20 examples).

(b) When the antecedent is expressed and is a noun or sub
stantive adjective, as in Most 413, uiri doetist opus quae dissig-
nata sint . . . tranquille cuneta ut proueniant (2 exemplos).

(e) When the antecedent is expressed and is a demonstrative
pronoun,-—is, ille, etc, asin Our'e. 29, ne id quod ames . . ·. tibi
sit probro (4 examples).

2. Similarly the relative clause when attached to the object oi
the verb is found to bo attracted:

(a) When the antecedent is not expressed‚ as in Epid. 6, di
dent quae uelis (4'1 exemplos).

(b) When the antecedent is expressed and is a noun, as in (tur.
550, tuom qui signum ad me attulisset nuntium ne spernerem

(5 examples).
