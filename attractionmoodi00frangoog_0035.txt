In the following, on the other hand, we seem to have a clear
case of attraction: Poen. 681, uidere equidem uos uellem quom
huic aurum darem, “ I should like to have you see when I give him
the money.'' The fact seems to be that, after conditional subjunc-
tives and subjunctivae of ideal certainty, Latin ireely conceives
of the subordinate act from tha ideal point oi view, unless the fact
of its objectiva reolily 11 to be emphasimd, 11 in Aul. 482, inuidia

The indirect question was evidently passing through 11 im·
portant change in the time of Plautus We need not here discuss
the process of the change; suffice it to say that the subjunctive
was coming to be the mood for these expressions, and that 1 feel·
ing was arising which demanded the subjunctive for 111 indirectly
quoted questions3 and when the quotation included a dependent
clause, this too naturally came to be put into the same mood if
it was felt to be 11 integral part of the original question. Thus,
in the following sentence, Mero 623, quin percontatu's, hominis
quae facies forat qui illam emissetl the quoted question includes
arelative clause, and the whole question “ hominis queo facies erat
qui illam amiserat ” 11 thrown into the subjunctive For the sake
of comparisou, I quote the following, in which the relative clause
is not conoeived of as 1 partui the quotation: Trin. ’1, quae illaec
siet huc quae abiit intro dicam.

Ι would suggest that the origins oi attraction in clauses oi this
sort go even deeper, and that the socalled relative clause in many
instanoes was still, as in its origin, actually felt as an interroga·
tive in dependence upon the main verb of the sentence.¹ I mean
