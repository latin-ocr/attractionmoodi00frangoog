Having'discussed the genesis 01 the construction, we must now
see how it behaved, how 101 11 extended, and what 101000 opposed
its workings.

I shall first give a 1101 01 subjunctives attracted by volitives 11
the primary clause, placing 1n a parallel column unattracted verbs
011110 same general nature, 101 convenience 010011ρο1001. I
shall group these with reference to the relative closeness 01 time
between 1110 dependent and independent verbs, 101 we have already
0001 that 0 shift 01 timesphere 10 0 most important consideration
in the matter 01 0111001101. The ¹remaining gronps will then be
treated in the same way in their proper order.

It is also necessary to note that identity 01 grammatica] tense
does not by any means imply identity 01 actual time. A univer·
sal present may, 101 instance, depend upon a present volitive sub
junctive3 both may be in the present subjunctive, while, in respect
to actual time, the volitive is future, and its subordinate verb is
present. 01 course, 101 the moment tbe speaker may be in the
iuture attitude 01 mind with regard to both verbs, but he is not
necessarily so. This general consideration must be applied to
verba 11 the other tenses as well.

, The following tables do not cont ain the verbs which refer to the
future, as 0 full list 01 these bas been grven On the 01 ther hand,
Ι111010 included the examples 01 the‘ ‘subjunctive 01 like feeling'’

'even when they have already been listed in the preceding, for
it 10 01 001100 quite impossible to state 1n any given case that the
10100 01 mechanica] attraction was not at work For past· futures
000 p 12. Except 1n the caseos indirect questions, where I found
it necessary to give complete stat 101100, Ι have excluded the verbs
which were clearly 1n indirect discourse-explicit or “implied.''

'‘Suoh verbs usually depend upon clauses introduced by impero,

postulo, etc, 01 by causal qued.
