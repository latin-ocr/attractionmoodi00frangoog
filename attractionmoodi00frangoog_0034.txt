Bacanal habere. of. Trin 472, siquid tibi placeat quod illi con·
gastum aiat, edisnel in which the conditional feeling is nearly aa
η strong in the quodclause as in the acleus In the following
there is more or less of the conditional feeling. It will be noticed
that tha dependant clause in the second example is, strictly speak-
ing, in grammatical dependenoe upon the apodosis of the sentence,
that is, upon a subjunctivo of Ideal Oartmnty. Quod uideas ia
equivalent to si quid uideas

Amph. 871, Nam mea sit culpa qaod egomet contraxerim
Si id Alcumenae innocenti expetat

Men. 111, Ni mala, ni stulta sis . . .
Quod uiro esse odio cidere tute tibi odio habeas.

There are numerous exemplos like the following:
Oapt aot, At pigeat postea nostrum erum si uos eximat uin·
culis aut solutos sinat quos argento omre,

in which there is a break in time-sphera, and the dependent clause,
if emphasis were given to its actual timefeeling, would not bc in
the subjunctive3 but the speaker for the moment conocivcs of tha
act from the ideal rather than the actual point of view, and ex·
presses this feeling by using the same mood as in the siclausa
cf. Bacch. 778, Ni facta oupi'am quae is uelit (strictly, “ what
he now wishes ”3 ideally, “whatever he may wish '’) tua iam
uirgis latera lacerentur proba. See also Oura, 2693 Bacch, 5643
Hac, 555.

In the same way a clause depending upon asubjunctivc of
Ideal Oertainty may, strictly speaking, state a general truth or an
objectiva fact, and at the sama time express that fact ideclly, that
is, with tha same mental attitude with which the rest of the clause
is uttered. The dependent verb is thus thrown into the same mood
and tense with tha verb on which it depende. A case in point in
the present tense may ba seen in Oia. 497, quodcumque optes tibi
uelim contingere, “ if you should desire a thing, I should like you
to have it'' Contrast Oura 82, Nam istunc qai fert afflictum
uelim. The following is an example of a clause depending upon
a verb contrary to fact: Bacch. 488, si opperiri uellem . . . ,
plus uiderem quant deceret, “ more than would be fitting,’' instead
