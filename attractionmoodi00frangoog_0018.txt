Akin to the subjunctive of indignation in feeling, though of
0 different origin,¹ is that which expresses “obligation or pro·
priety,'' and Ι eeeordingly treet it next In Hee. 658, 1111110,
quom eius alienum 0 me esse animum 0011110111, . . . quam ob
rem redducaml the main verb aaks 0 question of propriety in 0

tone 01 surprise, which latter feeling 1100 full possession 011110
subordinate verb and makes it subjunctive. The same is true in

Eun. 566, quid ego eius tibi 1111110 faeiem praedieem 0111 laudem,

Antipho, ptem ipsus 1110110110 quam elegans formarum spectator

Again, I should add to this Ι1101 many 01 the sooalled quieausal
clauses whieh 1110] be interpreted 00 expressing the same feeling,
end depend upon verbs in the subjunctive of propriety. So, ior
instance, Ι do 1101 000 why subjunctives like the following, with
qui, should bs plaoed in 0 different 01000 from those just cited
with quom:

M. G. 426, Quin ego hoo rogem qaod 1100010101

M. G. 556, Vidi: eur negem quod 1116011111]

Amph 434, Quid ego ni negem poi egomet 1101111

Τ1101111111110101 these examples in Plautus and Terence 10 large ’ .

There 010 also eertain subordinate clauses depending upon verbs

’ like mereo, whieh belong to this group. Thus in Men 1067,

non edepol 110 promeruisti de me ut pigeat pune uelis, “ you have
deserved better of me than that you should express a wish and
be disappointsd,” Ι should say 11101 the mood of uelis is 1101 due

to 0111001101, but eonveys the idea of propriety quite as 010011]
00 pigeat does. The feeling 01 remonstrenee is also strong in 1110
00100100000 of the following, in which 111 siet must be 01000011 as

0 substantive 0101100 of propriety (I should not, with Liihbert, p.
81, take the subjunctives with eum 00 due to mechanioal 011100
