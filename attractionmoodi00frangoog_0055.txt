In sentences containing independent subjunctives, and in many
conditional periods and in indirect questions, there is usually no

possibility of a central position for a dependent clause, but the
following table will show the relative importunes, under normal
conditions, of the three positione mentioned:

Ἴ (When the dependent clause lies before the governing subjunc-
tive and precedes all sign of its coming, it may be said to be in
the first position. The second positionis the centralone just illus·
trated. The third position is that in which the clause lies after

the governing πώ) ruma unane unone.

subjunctive 5 88 73
Indicetive ³4 87 les

It appears that the central position claime fifty-five percont.
of the attracted verbs, while only a third of those not attracted are
in that place

The dependent clause is occasionally found between the intro-
ductory conjunction and its verb, in conditional clauses lilre the
following: q

Pers. 206, si ut digne’s iaciant, odio hercle habeant,
and in imprecatione and expressions of wish, asin:

Aul. 785, utillum di immortales omnes deaeque quantumst per'·

duint;
but instances of this kind are not very numerous. The data in
regard to the position of verbs depending upon independent voli·
tive and optative sentences and upon conditional clauses and
clauses of ideal certainty are se follows:

semna MPoce’ttoa. comm
subjunctive 23 15 24

Indicativc 44 34 78

3. Pnno1s1orv ns Tnnsn nnn Monsn annrrve.

When precnion in certain respeots is required, the dependent
verb is seldom attracted.

(a) As regards time, the present subjunctive may stand for a
present or ’5 future indicative, and therefore is often of itseli
somewhst ambiguous. In the same way, the imperfect subjunc-
tive may be confusing in that it represents an imperfect indicative
or 5 future thrown into the past It may be for the sake of avoid·
