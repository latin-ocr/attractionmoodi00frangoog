future, of the nature discussed under the anticipatory, and we
saw that these were as a rule subjunctive, if conditione were not
unfavorable. This very fact would naturally give a strong im·

petus to attraction in the temporal clauses in particular. Before
giving the general table, Ι would point out the more important
habits of some of the individual temporal mnnectives.

’ 0111-Ι have attributed the subjunctive with cum, elsven
times to the inherent feeling of surprise, indignation, ete. (see pp.
8-11), three times to the necessities of its service as a past-future
(see p. 12), forty-three times to its future force after a subjunc

tive (see pp. 16-21), ten times to amore mechanical attraction. “

After a subjunctive, the cum temporal clause has been found
in the future indicative twalvs times, in the present indicative
seven times, andin the perfect indicative twice. We have found
the verb with eumenusal attracted five times, and unattracted
seven times3 I would, however, call attention to the fact that the
causal connection is not functionally a close one, as is seen in the
cass of the numerous loosely attached quicausal clauses Adding
to this consideration the interesting fact that the quandocamal
clause, out of fifteen opportunities, is not once auracud in Plau·
tus and Terence, I would suggest that the word attraction must
nothe employed too frequently as a wastebaslret, in attempting
to remove troublesome subjunctive eumeleuses from Early Latin
The following verbs astercum I have elassed with perfect subjunc
tives rather than future perfect indicatives after comparing their
nature and position with those to which no doubt is attached:

Men. 543, ut te lubenter uideam quom ad nos ueneris.

Trin. 621, Ospt. 434, Truc 234, Gapt. 47 3, Ε11. 933, Hee. 694.
The following, I think, are indicative: Oas. 130, Heaut. 557,
Phorm. 185.

Quando-This conjunction does not seem to be used in Terence
as purely temporal¹ The stetistics which are found below re
garding this conjunctiora apply, therefore, mainly to Plautus. As
verbs after quaudo-comat are not found to be attracted, Ι have
not even placed the non-attracted indicatives of this class in my

tables, but for the sake of eompleteness give a list of them here:
Oapt 12, Men. 834, Μ. (1. 1269, Bacch. 445, Poen. 815, Rud.
