THE SOUROES OF THE CONSTBUGTION· 29

We have also noticed (p. 21) that the anticipatory indirect
questions must bc rechoned with in this account, if we are right
in supposing that their force will help to account for the mood of
verbs like adimet in the following: Phorm. 161, expecto quam
mox ueniat qui adimat hanc mihi consuetudinem.

Sonam.

We have now examined the more objectiva forces which were
at work in developing the construction in question, and with our
eye upon the facts so far found, are ready to make a partial 'state-
ment in regard to what attraction is and what it is not. It has
become clear, I think, that attraction is more than a “ Streben nach
Ooncinnitiit des Ausdrucks '' (Draeger, I, p. 316) in each indi·
vidual instance-it is not even a habit which springs purely and
simply from such a strehea (“ hervorgegangen,'' ibid). The
phrase “ Streben nach Concinnitiit'' implica a feeling for style
which comes with a highly developed prose, and I fear definitione
like the one just quoted come from an examinationes attraction
as used by Oicero in his hest prose-where it actually merges into
such an “ effort at concinnity,”—and not from an historica] study
of the construction. This is rather a habit which took shape under
the influence of the several similar constructione that we have dis·
cusscd in the preceding, and it worked outward from those definite
sterling-points along the lines governed by the laws of analcgy.
True it is thatin the examples of the original type, the subjunc
tive cf the dependent clause was due to the fact that this clause
happened to contain the same modal feeling as the governing
clause. But in the growing construction of attraction proper,
identity of mental attitude is not a sine qua non of its occurrence.
Attraction then appears to bc in the main a phencmencn of nat·
ural linguistic evolution which falls under the category of analogy
working mechanically, rather than of a conscious (or unconscious)
mental attitude¹ connected with stylistic consideratione. As we
have seen, its origine are found in the language, not of artistic

¹1 have been careful to say that this is only a “ partial statement,” for I
fully understand the danger cf neglecting tha clement of dom διάθεσις ln tha
discussion cf a construction as subjective as this. Thera arc psychological
consideratione that must be taken into account before the final definitior is
given. Ι shall have something to say on this point in a later papcr.
