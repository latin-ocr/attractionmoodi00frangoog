A number oi years ego Professor Hele pointed out the wsy in
which the origine oi the construction now under examinetion must
be studied. He says in his ‘sequence of Tenses' (American
Joumol of Philolopy, VIII [1888], 1, p. 543 and American Jour-
nal ef Philoloqy, IX [1889], 2, pp. 175-o)z “ In complex sen·
tences mede up of amain sentence with subjunctive verb end one
or more subordinate sentences, the model feeling in the speaker’s
mind which expresses itself in the mein sentence is, in the nature
of things, very likely to continue in the speaker's mind in the
subordinated sentence or sentences, either quite unchsnged or but
slightly ehaded. If, ior example, I sey in Latin, ‘Iet him send
whom he will,' mittat quem velit, the mood in velit is not a case
of ‘attractae' or ‘assimilarem’ at alt · Velit is as much a
jussive ae mittat is. The meaning is, ‘Let him choose bis man, ’
and send thet men '3 or, in older English, ‘ Ohoose he his men and
eend him' In eei ques erent quei ribei deicerent neaerae ese
Bccoeol hebere (Ο. Ι. L, I, 196), the deicerent is as much a
future condition (τεεί ques deicerent) as esent is.’' Agein,
“the frequent recurrence oi such exemples pices risa to the occe·
sionel use of a dependent subjunctive with only a formal liheneee
to the main subjunctive, and no true model feeling.’' Later he
reiteretes the statement in a paper on the Antioipatory Sub·
junctive¹ (p. 63, iootnote).

This wording implies, of course, that the construction in ques-
tionis a thing hroepbt abead and developed. As for Professor
Hale's interpretation of the mood of velit end deicerent, there can
be no dispute, and it is my belief thet, in the other main divi·
sions oi the subjunctive also, e great number oi the cases usually
treated as exemples of attraction are to be interpreted in the same
