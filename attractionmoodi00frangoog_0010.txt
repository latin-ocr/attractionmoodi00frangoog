from the point of view of their special topic. Thus Ltbberts
places certain eumeleuses in Plautus under the category of at·
traction. Elste,² Richardson⁸ and Boettger⁴ explain certain
exemplos of the subjunctive with dum ae due to the same influ-
enoe. Sohubert⁶ Lange⁶ and Rodenhusehi should also be men·
tioned as having touched the subject incidentelly, the latter two
at least with some insight. The lists of Holtze,⁸ which are sup
poeed to cover the field of Early Latin, are not half complete, eon·
stantly betray a lach of understanding of Early Latin usage, and

pretation of every example, nor in all of my reasoning.

As regards my way of approaching the subject, -it may be said
that, after working for a considerable time over 'the whole range
of Latin literature, I discovered that Ι was dealing with a chang-
ing construction, and that, therefore, a historica] treatment was
the only logical one. Furthermore, it became apparent that the
origine of the use of the subjunctive by attraction ere not to bo
looked for in the languege of artistic prose, with its various con-

such writing, andin simpler form. On the other hand, since the
