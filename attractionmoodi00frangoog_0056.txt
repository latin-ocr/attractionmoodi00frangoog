ing this possible ambiguity that the future indicative occurs in a
few sentences like the following:

Bacch 989, Volo ut quod iubebo facias.
and the present indicative in many sentences like this:

M. G. 1054, Age, . . . fiat quod te ore.
In the same way, the imperfect indicative (cupiebam) in the iol-
lowing prevents the interpretation oi the verb as a past future of
a generalizing clause, which would have been possible if the verb
had become imperfect subjunctive by attraction:

Eun. 574, Ut essem una quacum cupiebam
Itis at least true that no verb in Early Latin is attracted if it is
modified by a temporal adverb which refers to a time differing
from thet of the governing clause. Oi:

Andr. 339, ubi inueniam Pamphilum
ut metum in quo onere est adimaml

(b) Further, the indicative must obvioust stand when precision
in model feeling is celled for. So often does the tone of the gov-
erning clause penetrate to the dependent verb that the mind is
continually erpecting to find it there. In a grem number of cases,
though it is not definitely called for, it matters little if there is
a shading of it; but often it is very essential to state a plain fact
which is wholly devoid of the volitive, optative or conditional atti·
tude of the governing verb. The terms “integral part '' or
“ essential part'' sre ambiguous for the reason that they ignore
considerations of this nature. A clause may be iunctionclly an
inteprol port of its sentence, and easerdiol to its meaning without
having its mood. On the other hand, if these terme are used with
the understanding that they convey the modal end temporal feel·
ing of the main sentence, such use ignores the fact of mechanioal
attraction. The following sentence will illustrate what I mean
in speaking of precision in mood secured by the indicative:

Pers. 293, Di deaeque me omnes perdant-ll
eueniant uolo tibi quae optas.

’ Quae optas refers definitely to the prayer just uttered. A sub-
junctive here would have been ambiguous, as it might have been
equivalent to the ebove if attracted, or could have been understood
es partaking of the optative nature of eueniant, 01· as conditional. '
