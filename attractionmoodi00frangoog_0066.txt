The first part of this paper makes an attempt (1) to explain
the origin and (2) to describe the growth of the construction oi
model attraction. (1) It endeavors to show that from several
constructione (enumerated on p. 7) in which the dependent clause
contained the model force oi the governing clause, the tendency
arose which was the source oi the constructiones model attraction.
(2) It attempts to describe how this beginning developed by the
lewes analogy into a habit of placing dependent clauses in the
subjunctive when attached to clauses of that mood.

The second part of the paper, aiter giving a complete list oi
the clauses in dependence upon subjunctivae in early Latin, at·
tempta to detine the limits oi the field into which the construction
in question spread in that period, and to point out the obstacles
which so limited it. This discussion shows with more definiteness
than can be reprcduced in a general statement, (1) that the at·
treated clause is preferably in the same timesphere as the clause
on which it¹ depends; (2) that its iavorite position is between the
introductory conjunction (when such existe) and the verb oi the
governing clause 3 (3) that its verb rarely expresses precise moda]
and temporal force3 (4) that the clause aa a whole is rather oi
the generalizing than of the determinative type; (5) that it is
more frequently a temporal than a relative clause3 (6) that it is
connected with the predicate more frequently than with the sub
ject or object oi the sentence, and (l) that, as a mle, it is an
essential clause, and grammatically. depends very closely upon
the main body of tha clause to which it is abached.

The above, I think, are praetieally all and the only statements
oi importance that ,can be made regarding the limitatione oi its
⁹ uses in Early Latin It is sometimes said¹ that under given oon·
ditions a clause is inevitably attracted On the contrary, I be-
lieve that the comparative tables given above and the discussion
oi the same have made it evident that attraction is never abso
