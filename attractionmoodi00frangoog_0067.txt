lutely necessary. Praetically every example oi attraction was
balanced by one or several non-attracted clauses which, so far as

closeness oi attachment ie concerned, were oi the same nature as
the attracted clauses which they resembled

These results may seem somewhat unsatisfactory in that nc
single short statement has been found adaquata in defining the
constmetion. However, a short definitior may serve the peda·
gogical purposee oi those who correotly understand the usagee of
tha construction, and know the actual facts about its limitatione
ae I have tried to present them in the preceding. A rule may
be formulated somewhat ae follows: When a clause depending
upon a subjunctive clause forms an essential part oi the thought
of the governing clause, it may be put in the subjunctive. In
this rule, however, the word “ cesential ’' must be interpreted in
tha light oi all of the preceding discussion; and it must be re-

membered that the probability oi the assimilationes a clausa ,

varies with its success or noneucoeee in complying with the quali·
ficatione hersin enumerated These are quite tangible, and, as
we have seen, land themselves readily to definite, statistical treat-
ment To one who understands these the study may bring eatis·

Finally I would protest against the common custom of treating
this construction ae a kind of Indireet Discourse. This error ie
probably due to the fact that tha two constmctions behave in much
the same way, and are to a certain extent affected by the same
limitatione Itis also true that one often finds it difficult, not
to say impossible, to decide whether a verb ie influenced by one
or the other, or by both. We have seen, however, that there is
very little in common between thern. Their origine are widely
separated, and any grammar that purports to be historical should
treat them separately.

Again, the construction of assimilation should be carefully dis·
tinguished from that which occurs after an infinitiva. The two
have in many particulare the same beginnings, they have prae
tically the same habits, but the latter is more closely allied to that
oi Indirect Discourse than the former, and ie oi rerer occurrence
