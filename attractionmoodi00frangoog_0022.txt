Blase² goes eo far even as to accept Rodenbusch's explanation
of the subjunctive for the following independent sentences in

Plfflli 1060: Nec me miserior feminast neque ulla 11111111
. Trfflllll t Nunquam hoc uno die efficietur opus.

Now that the existence of this subjunctive has become so widely
recognized, 11 will no longer seem an unnatural interpretation to

that these very esses had by the time of Plautus gone so far in creating a
habit for attraction that even present generaliaing clauses of the same gen·
eral nature are frequently in the subjunctive, and that this habit had
been strengthened by a factor already referred to (p. 5), in which, even in
the present tense, the subordinate clause is subjunctive by the exteueiou ot the
model feeling from the governing verb. The dependent clause of Pseud. 036,
tantum tihi boni di immortales duint quantum tu tibi eaoptea, certainly refers
to the present time, for the wish in question had just been expressed
Nevertheless 11 11 in the subjunctive moed. The context is equally explicit in
referring the dependent verb ot M. 0. 1030, (11 tibi dent quaequomque optes, to
the present. For turther examples, see the list 11 p. 11 111111111111
