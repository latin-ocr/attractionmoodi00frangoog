In fact both of these points are well illustrated by a number of
sentences in which the contrast of time and of modol feeling is
brought ont by contrasting a subjunctive verb with the indicative
of the same verb Sec the following:

Trin. 351, Quod habes ne habeas et illuc qnod non habes habeas.

anteeant inuidia nos minore utamur quarn utimur
Et illae malam rem metuant quam metuont magis
Et nos minore sumptu simos quam sumus.

(a) In fact, as any contrast necessarily calls for an explicit
statement of the contrasted parts, wherever such a condition pre-
vails there is less likelihood of attraction So in the following
there is a contrast between the subjecto ta andepo:

Trin. 341, Non eo haec dico quin quae ta osis ayo nelina
A contrast of this kind may bc brought out by some other word
in the sentence, as by pariter in the following:

(lap. 329, Nunc hoc animum aduerte nt ea quae sentio pariter

sores
or by the tone of the context, as in the following:
Trin. 979, Dum ille aa sia quem ego esse nolo.

A comparison of the determinative with the generalizing elanses
will prove that the readiness with which a verb is attracted de
penda to a grean extent on the fimetion of its clause as a part of
the sentence The determinative clause is necessarily precise in
its statements¹ It aima at accuracy in the expression of its modal
and temporal feeling, and is apt to possess a peculiar emphasis
from this fact In dependenoe upon a volitive or optative verb it
is therefore likely, by remaining in the indicative, to deny that it
partakes in any respect of the tone of the governing verb: and in
subjunctive conditional sentences, where the Roman was so prone
to cast the shadow of the ideal even over clauses which expressed
facts generally known to be true, the determinative clause is much
less frequently attracted thanis the generalizing clause. Con·
trast, for example, the following, which is determinative:

Rud. st 8, alictarius sit qaod memoras, piscatores perierint,
with this, which is generalizing: ¹
