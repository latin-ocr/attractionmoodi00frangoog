of the conditional sentences of Early Latin 'shows that when there
is a question of mixed conditione, the siclause is quite regularly
in the subjunctive if the main clauae is an apodosis of the regular·
type in the subjunctive. There are but thirteen exceptione, of
which the following is an illustration:

Mer. 351, si dico ut res est . . . quem admodum existumet
mel

This fact becomes the more noteworthy when one finds that 129
exceptione occur in the converse type, which means that the prin·
cipal clause of the conditional sentence is very often indicativa
though connected with a subjunctive protasis, as in:

M. G. 673, siquid sumas, sumptus eet

. This contraet eemainly points to assimilation of the protasis to
the mood of the apodosis.

I find it impossible to be more explicit than thie, and as it would
· be useless to attempt to decide in particular cases whether a si·

clause is attracted or not, none oi this class will be found in the
tables.

The ut· aad quomeloueca of comparum-The utolause of com·
parison is sometimes said, in the hand-books, to avoid the mood
used with final· and consecutivam, for the sake of cleamees. It
ie true that though this is an adverbial clause, it ie not often at
tracted3 but I doubt whether the real cause of the fact is the rea·
son given This clause often precludee assimilation by its very
nature, since, as has been pointed ont (p. 49), comparieone and
contraete naturally tend to throw emphasis upon tha verbs juxta·
posed, which fact entails precision in expression of the modal and
tempora] force Oi:

Mera 87 4, ei bue item properea ut etue properae iacias rectius.
But this consideration is equally true oi quam in comparisone
and all other comparative and contrasting expressions. Tho iol·
lowing may represent a large group of this kind:

True. 324, si proinde amentur mulieres diu quam lauant

Again, the next paragraph will show that many of these clauses,
adverbial though they are, depend upon adjectivae at 'a second re
move from the verb of the governing clause. These two reasons
will account for the fact that such clauses are not attracted aa
frequently ae the other adverbial clauses.
