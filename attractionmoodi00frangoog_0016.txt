is a ease of attraction. This statement may become clearer if we
compare the following sentence, in which the explanatory clause,
which is much like theone just discussed, is 1111 in the indica·
tive:

Men. 560, Egone hic me patiar in matrimonio
Ubi uir compilet clanculum 1111ᾳυὶ1 demut?

In the following the subordinate verbs are, if my interpretation
is right, in the subjunctive, not by mechanical attraction, but

Pseud. 184, 111 uost uestros panticesque adeo madefwtatis quom epo eim
hic siccus! Here Lange (De Sententiarum Temporalium apud Prisc. Ser. Lat.
Syntaxi, p. 45) needlessly proposes to emend madescentis to 111111ΐωί1111, in
order to get a raison d'etre for the mood of 1111.

Gapt. 892, dubium habebis etiam, sancte quom ego torem tibit

In the first of these examples the force is not felt with such strength, at the
moment when sum and curo are uttered, as to call tor the subjunctiv03 but the
speaker's indignation rises as he proceeds, and finds tull expression 11 etat and
oporteat. I would add to this list Ad. lou, noui ego uostra haec “nollem
lactum, dabitur ius iurandum, indignum te esse iniuria hac,” indignis quom
egomet 1111 acceptus modis. The tone ot the last clearly is “to think 11
coming with such excuses, citer l boue been 111111 iu tuis woyt'' huga (ibid,
p. 43) goes lar afield in saying that the meod ol the cum-clause is due to its
dependence upon the infinitiva, and Ldbbert (Die syntax von Quom, p. 140)
makes it one of the two clauses iu Terence which are in this mood because
ol 1 111111 quom. It we arc right in recogniaing this force in the dependent
tenporal clauses above (with a main verb in the indicative), we shall also
recognize it when a subjunctive clause vvith ubi or cum is found in dependeuce
upon a subjunctive; lor the existence ol such clauses after an indicative proves
that those which we find aiter a subjunctive are not necessarily in that mood
1111111 of attractiou, but possibly by their ovvn inherent force. I should like·
wise suggest that many ol the socalled causal and adversative quiclauses in
Plautus and Terence should rather be explained aa due to the presence ol this
other force. For, if we are right in recognizing the subjunctive of surprise
or indignation alter a cum (ct. Bacch. 1192, Egon quom haec 1111 1111 demetet
inspectent) and ubi (Epid. 588, Non patrem ego te nominem ubi tu tuam me
appelles 11111111), we should naturally do so after qui in clauses ol the same
nature, as in Pers. 27, deisne aduorser quasi Titani, cum eis belligerem,
quibus sat esse 1111111111 and in Rud. 1244, Egone nt qaod ad me allatum
esse alienum sciam celem? Note how closely, in the two examples following,
the qui-clause and the cum-clause correspond: M. d. 964, Vah, egone ut ad
te ab libertina esse auderem internuntius, qui ingenuis satis responsare
nequeas! Most. 896, Tibi obtemperem quom tu mihi nequeas!
