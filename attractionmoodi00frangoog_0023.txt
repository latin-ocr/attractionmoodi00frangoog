rna sonncns or rrrn consrnuorrorr. 15

take optes of the sentence cited by Mr. Hale (di tibi deniquae
cumque optes) as a survival of the Anticipetory subjunctive, and
to state that these anticipatory subjunctives, surviving, as is nat
ural, aiter present subjunctivae referring to the future, formed
an important iniluence in the development of the bobii of attrac-

tion.¹ 'An examination of the table following will show theta
very large percentage of the verbs referring to the future and
depending upon a verb in the subjunctive is placed in the same
mood3 that in fact the percentagc is far higher here than in any
other timesphere3 and that if, in addition to referring to the
future, the subordinate verbis placed in cloec proximity to the
governing subjunctive (ci. p. 46), itis almost invariably in tha
same mood

the indicative, not because it does not reicr to the future, but tecue it ia
a very definite determinative clause (=quae modo optaviati) (ci. p. 41)).

ι Blase was probably led astray by the erroneoue statement oi Lange (loc. cit,

p. dil: Hic usus apud Plautum et Terentium certis etiamdum finibus con·
strictus iuitz tum enim solum adbibitus est cnm in enuntiatione demon·
strativa futura aliqua notio continetur. But Lange had himself acen that
the subordinate verb, even when referring to¹ the future, was leae frequently
in the subjunctive when it preceded the main subjunctive than when it was
closely attached to it (p. 31)). A eharper anelysie then, even ii Bleae failed
in data, would have led him to the conclusion that the mood in these cases
was not wholly a matter oi the expressiones the idea oi iuturity, but in some
ei them was due tc the proximity ci the clause to the subjunctive oi the
governing clause, i. e., to meobcctiocl attraction.

¹In this connection it should be noted that the examplea oi attraction-
socalled-wbich occur in Oecan and Umbrian are verbe which refer to the
rueme. The list is aa follows:

1. pun iar kahad, nip putiiad edum. (Curae oi Vibia.) (When he takes
iood may he not be able to eat.) (Buck, Oea-Umbr. Verbflystem, p. 147.)

2. prohetia, pi'r'e ureku ri esuna si herta, ct pure esum sis. iguv. Tab.
V, a, b. (praehibeat quidquid ad illem rem diuinam ait oporteat, etqui in
diuino sint Budr, Osc.·Umbr. VerbSystem p. 144.)

3. persei marsei (t) depending upon a subjunctive. Igur. Tab. VI, a, 28,
38, 48. )“ So iar as is right.”) This ia notan undoubted instance. See
Buck, Osa-Umbr. Grammar, p. 218.

Mr. Baclairom whose paper (The Oscae-Umbriae Verb system) Ihave taken
these examplea, adds in a ioctnote (p. 149) “ Assimilation may be a conserving
rather than a creative force, may merely tend to preserve an old construction
against the inroads oi the future indicative.”
